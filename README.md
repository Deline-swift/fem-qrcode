## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS for styling
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt how to use CSS custom properties which helped me to easily reuse styles in my design. In the snippet below i defined colors,font-weight and font-sizes i used in my design




```css
:root{
    --fs-p:50px;
    --fw-1:700px;
    --fw-2:400px;
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
   --Slate300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --Slate500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --Slate900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);

    --sm:375px;
    --lg:1440px;
    
}
```



### Continued development
Am still not very comfortable with position in css so thats one thing i look forward to working on.


### Useful resources
